# CConverter Bot

You can try bot by following this link: https://t.me/CConventerBot Before you do that, text me to enable the bot: https://t.me/dakonxd
If for some reason you want to try run it by yourself or develop it any futher, you will need , DeepL API, and your own Telegram bot API. 
Do not forget to put them into corresponding classes. OpenAI for Service class, DeepL for Translator class, Telegram bot for Bot class.

Also, for better understanding, make sure to check libriries used: https://github.com/rubenlagus/TelegramBots and https://github.com/DeepLcom/deepl-java. 
For OpenAI I did found any good library, so just used JsonObjects. More detailed information about how it works you can find in the code comments.
